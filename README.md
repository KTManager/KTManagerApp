# Kill Team Manager App

For the benefit of the community, we're releasing the Kill Team Manager app
source code here. Check out LICENSE for details on licensing and consider
making a pull request if you want to contribute changes.

## History

tl;dr: The app was originally written in French and with a sqlite db for the
rules, which explains some of the tech debt and design decisions you might
see.

We've since done a bunch of translating and moved the hard-coded db out of
the repo in favor of rules in json (see the KTRules repo).
